Every developer who wants to show of their projects or at least need to present
some kind of online presence for their job applications needs a portfolio.
I think it doesn't really matter if it's your GitHub Page with all your repos or
your LinkedIn page you send with your Application.

But maybe you stumble over the idea of creating your on portfolio website.
Now the only question is: Which Tech Stack do you want to use?

React.js , Svelte or Vue.js? Or use Next.js instead. Maybe some Tailwindcss for the styling
and Framer Motion for animations. Than a Backend for some cool dynamic content (Express.js) and
a NoSQL database like MongoDB because you are afraid of PostgreSQL.

If you like this idea than go for it. You will probably learn a lot of useful stuff on the way.
But if you want to keep your sanity, than you might just relaxe and stick to plain html and css.

## Simple

In my opinion keeping it simple is the way to go. All these overengineerd portfolios with all these animations
and transitions look pretty cool. But let's be honest. Why? If you are a Frontend developer or Webdesigner that sure
a good looking portfolio makes a lot of sense. But if your only project is a todolist written in javascript, you might
as well just forgot about presenting this project on a portfolio real quick.

I like simple websites. Simple doesn't mean boring or ugly. It just means, that your removing unnecacarry stuff which do not
really contribute in a positive way to your website.
Just take a look at these examples:

- [mr-cheffy](https://cheff.dev/) (Developes the [zen browser](https://zen-browser.app/))
- [DHH](https://dhh.dk/) (Creator of [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/))
- [Mitchel Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com/) (Creator of [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) and [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/))

## But why Astro

Why do i use [Astro.js](https://astro.build/) if i just said to keep it simple.
I used to write my portfolios in simple html, css and this is perfectly fine. You can do a lot nowadays with modern
css and html. You can also use Next.js or something simular but i think the core concept should be to keep it simple
and let your portfolio speek for itself. 

I find Astro to be incedibly simple to use. There is a default blog template which you can use without the need
to start with some predefined themes. Just a litte bit of tweeking and your ready to go. But you still have the
freedom to adjust anything you want.
